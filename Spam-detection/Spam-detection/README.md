# Spam Detection Project

This repository contains a spam detection project that utilizes a Naive Bayes classifier to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The project achieves an accuracy of 98 percent.

## Project Overview

The main component of the project is the `project.ipynb` file, which includes the code for the spam detection project. It covers the following steps:

1. Dataset Import: The project begins by importing the dataset needed for training and testing the spam detection model.

2. Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to clean the data and extract relevant features for the classification task.

3. Model Training: The Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset using the appropriate training algorithm.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained classifier is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure its accuracy in spam detection. The project reports an accuracy of 98 percent.

## Instructions

To run the project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the `.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

3. Execute the notebook cells in sequential order to perform dataset import, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Analyze the results and explore the code to gain insights into the spam detection process.

## Conclusion

This spam detection project showcases the effectiveness of the Naive Bayes classifier in classifying emails as spam or non-spam. With an accuracy of 98 percent, the model demonstrates its ability to accurately identify spam messages.

Feel free to explore the `project.ipynb` file and the dataset provided in this repository.

Happy spam detection!
